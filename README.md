# Description
<p> As a follow-up to my 1994_Census project, I wanted to expand my knowledge of Neural Networks by applying similar classification techniques but altering them to work in a multi-class classification project - that is to say a dataset with 3 or more targets.</p>

# Results
<p> The neural network appears to be working well, producing roughly the precision/recall/f1-values as my previous nn project did.</p>

<p>From this project, I learned that the only activation function that is usable for multi-class classification is "Softmax".</p>
